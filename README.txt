‚ùó Notes 
- D&D 5e Character Builder

Overview

The D&D 5e Character Builder is a web-based application designed to help you create and manage your Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition (D&D 5e) characters. The application focuses on generating and managing character stats, calculating Armor Class (AC), and Hit Points (HP). It allows you to save and download your character notes, ensuring you can keep track of your character's details easily.

Key Functionalities

Character Details:

Character Name: Enter the name of your character.
Character Class: Select a class from a dropdown list. Each class is accompanied by its "Hit Die," which determines the base HP for the character.
Character Race: Choose a race from a dropdown list. Note that the race does not influence the stats or modifiers; only the class hit die affects HP.
Character Stats:

Generate Stats: Click the "Generate New Stats" button to automatically roll the stats for your character. The stats are generated by rolling four six-sided dice (4d6), dropping the lowest roll, and summing the remaining three.
Modify Stats: You can manually adjust the stats using input fields. The modifiers are automatically recalculated based on the new stats.
AC Calculation: The Armor Class (AC) is calculated as 10 plus the Dexterity modifier.
HP Calculation: Hit Points (HP) are calculated based on the class hit die and the Constitution modifier.

Character Notes:

Save Stats to Notes: Click this button to save the current character details, stats, AC, and HP to a notes section.
Save Note: Save the content of the notes section as a text file for offline storage.
Clear: Clear the notes section to start fresh.

How It Works

Generate Stats: When you click the "Generate New Stats" button, the application rolls the dice to generate six stats (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma). It also calculates the modifiers and AC based on the generated stats.
Hit Die Influence: The hit die specified in the character class (e.g., d6 for Sorcerer, d10 for Fighter) determines the base HP for the character. The Constitution modifier is added to this base HP to get the total HP.

Saving Notes: You can save the character details and stats to a notes section, which can then be saved as a text file. This allows you to keep a record of your character's progress and details.
